### BI

- template fragments now reside in `pinax/webanalytics/`
- settings prefixes changed from `METRON_` to `PINAX_WEBANALYTICS_`
- `request.metron_site_id` changed to `request.pwa_site_id`, but still defaults to `settings.SITE_ID` if not on `request` object
- the session key name now defaults to `_pwa_activity` instead of `_metron_activity`

## 1.3

- site ID keys in METRON_SETTINGS can reference the value stored in
  ``request.metron_site_id`` (useful for multi-tenancy setups)

## 1.2

- Upgraded mixpanel

## 1.1

- ``SITE_ID`` is now always treated as an int on lookup so the keys in
  ``METRON_SETTINGS`` must be ints
- analytics template tag now bails out silently if ``user`` or ``request`` are
  missing from context

- same as 0.2

## 0.2
